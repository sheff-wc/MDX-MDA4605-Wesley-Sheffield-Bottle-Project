Current test keywords can be found in the db.js file. You can test these keywords or add your own.
To test the arrival message functionality, please change one of the test entries in the db.js file array, or add a new point and make the location of the point at or very near your location. Once you mark your location on the map with the button on the top right interface, a popup should show you the arrival message if your location is close enough.
Please note that the array is formatted/arranged as follows: ["keyword", "longitude", "latitude", "arrival message"]
